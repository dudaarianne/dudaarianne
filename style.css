/*WEB DESIGN VS. DEVELOPMENT
Web designers create the overall look and feel of a website;
Web developers implement the design using HTML, CSS and JavaScript code

WEB DESIGN INGREDIENTS
1. Typography
  Serif vs Sans-serif
  Serif:
  --> Creates a traditional/classic look and feel
  --> Conveys trustworthiness
  --> Good for long text
  Sans-serif:
  --> Modern look and feel
  --> Clean and simple;
  --> Easier to choose for beginner design!

  a) Use Good Typefaces 
    (TOOLBOX: Google Fonts; Font Squirril )
    Sans-serif:
    -Inter
    -Open Sans
    -Roboto
    -Montserrat
    -Work Sans
    -Lato

    Serif:
    -Merriweather
    -Aleo
    -Playfair Display
    -Cormorant
    -Cardo
    -Lora
  
    1- Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe
    2- It's okay to use just one typeface per page! If you want more, limit to 2 typefaces.
    3- Choose the right typeface according to your website personality:
      --> Choose the right personality for your design
      --> Decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
      --> Experiment with all the "good" typefaces to see which one best fits your website's message
      --> You can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build the page.

  b) Use Good Font Sizes and Weights
    4- When choosing font-sizes, limit choices! Use a "type scale" tool or other pre-defined range (TOOLBOX: type-scale.com)
    5- Use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text
    6- For long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger
    7- For headlines, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), depending on personality
    8- For any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)
    
  c) Create A Good Reading Experience
    9- Use less than 75 characters per line
    10- For normal-sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. For big text, go below 1.5
    11- Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural
    12- Experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and bold and increase letter-space
    13- Don't justify text
    14- Don't center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

2. Colors
  a) Choose the Right Color
    1. Make the main color match your website's personality: colors convey meaning!
      Red draws a lot of attention, and symbolizes power, passion, and excitement
      Orange is less aggressive, and conveys happines, cheerfulness, and creativity
      Yellow means joy, brightness, and intelligence
      Green represents harmony, nature, growth, and health
      Blue is associated with peace, trust worthiness, and professionalism
      Purple conveys wealth, wisdom, and magic
      Pink represents romance, care, and affection
      Brown is associated with nature, durability and comfort
      Black symbolizes power, elegance and minimalism, but also grif and sorrow
    
    2. Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone or CSS named colors 
        (TOOLBOX: Open color, tailwindcss, flat UI colors 2)

  b) Establish a Color System
    3. You need at least two types of colors in your color palette: a main color and a grey color
    4. With more experience, you can add more colors: accent colors 
    (TOOLBOX: Open color, tailwindcss, flat UI colors 2, palleton.com, coolors, Tint & Shade Generator)
    5. For diversity, create lighter and darker versions (tints and shades)
    6. Use your main color to draw attention to the most important elements on the page
    7. Use colors to add interesting accents or make entire components or sections stand out
    8. You can try to use your color strategically in images and illustrations;
    
  c) Colors and Typography
    9. On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint os the background for text;
    10. Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting;
    11. Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between text and background colors (accessibility);
      --> Contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for larger text (18px+)    
      
3. Images/Illustrations
  a) Use Good Images
    1. Different types of images: product photos, storytelling fotos, illustrations, patterns
    2. Use images to support your website's message and story. So only use relevant images!
    3. Prefer original images. If not possible, use original looking stock images (not generic ones!)
    (TOOLBOX: Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw)

  b) Use Images Well
    4. Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions
    5. If necessary, crop images to fit your message 
    6. Experiment combinig photos, illustrations and patterns

  c) Handling Text On Images
    7. Method #1: Darker or brighten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)
    8. Method #2: Position text into neutral image area
    9. Method #3: Put text in a box

  d) Some Technical Details
    10. To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size
    --> Scale factor: Actual pixels the screen contains/Pixels represented on screen
    --> On high-res screens, scale fator is 2x or even 3x, on "normal" screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)
    11. Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
    (TOOLBOX: Unsplash, Pexels, DrawKit, unDraw, Sqoosh)
    12. When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions

4. Icons
  a)Use Good Icons
    1. Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons packs
    (TOOLBOX: Phosphor icons, ionicons, icons8, heroicons, emojis...)
    2. Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs
    3. Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image formats (.jpg and .png)
    --> Vector-Based ??
        --> SVG images and icon fonts
        --> Scale indefinetely! 
    --> Bitmap ??
        --> "Regular images": JPG, PNG, GIF
        --> Do not scale, become unsharp!
    4.Adjust to website personality! Roudness, weight and filled/outlined depend on typography
  
  b) When To Use Icons
    5. Use icons to provide visual assistancee to text
    6. Use icons for product feature blocks
    7. Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no space or icon is 100% clear)
    8. Use icons as bullet points

  c) Use Icons Well
    9. To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more attention, use different color
    10. Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action
    11. Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If needed, enclose them in a shape

5. Shadows
  a) Some Concepts First...
    --> After an era of 100% flat design, we're now back to using shadows in UI design ("flat design 2.0": still minimal, but brings back shadows and depth for better usability)
    --> Shador creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away from the interface the element is
    --> Shadow can be used on boxes and text

  b) Use Shadows Well
    1. You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense for the wwebsite personality
    2. Use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every element!
    3. Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark!
    
  c) Use Shadows In The Right Situation
    4. Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out (to draw attention)
    5. Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should out a bit more
    6. Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface
    7. Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)
    8. Bonus: Experiment with glows (colored shadows)

6. Border-radius
  a) Use Border-Radius Well
    1. Use Border-radius to increase the playfullness and fun of the design, to make it less serious
    2. Typefaces have a certain roudness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness!
        --> Very round typefaces, lots of border-radius in button, icons and images
        --> Boxy/square typefaces, but designers wantes to add some playfulness, so little border-radius
    3. Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, standout sections and other elements
    
7. Whitespace
  a) Why Whitespace
    --> The right amount of whitespace makes design look clean, modern and polished
    --> Whitespace communicates how different pieces of information are related to one another
    --> Whitespace implies invisible relationships between the elements of a layout
    
  b) Where To Use Whitespace
    1. Use tons os whitespace between sections
    2. Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
    3. Use whitespace between elements
    4. Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead of lines
  
  c) How Much Whitespace
    5. The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together, the closer they should be!
      --> The "Law of Proximity"
    6. Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then remove whitespace from there
      --> Too much whitespace looks detached, too little looks too crammed
    7. Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, you need more whitespace
    8. Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
    

8. Visual Hierarchy
  a) What Is Visual Hierarchy
    --> Visual hierarchy is about establishing which elements os a design are the most important ones. 
    --> Visul hierarchy is about drawing attention to these most important elements
    --> Visua hierarchy is about definig a "path" for users, to guide them through the page
    --> We use a combination of position, size, colors, spacing, borders, and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between elements/components

  b) Visual Hierarchy Fundamentals
    1. Position importatant elements closer to the top of the page, where they get more attention
    2. Use images mindfully, as they draw lot of attention (larger images get more attention)
    3. Whitespace creates separation, so use whitespace strategically to emphasize elements
  
  c) Visual Hierarchy For Text Elements
    4. For text elements, use font size, font weight, color, and whitespace to convey importance
    5. What text elements to emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons, data points, icons
    --> You can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or secondary/additional information

  d) Visual Hierarchy Between Components
    6. Emphasize an important component using background color, shadow, or border (or multiple)
    7. Try emphasizing some component A over component B by de-emphasizing component B
    8. What components to emphasize? Testimonials, call-to-action sections, highlight sections, preview cards, forms, pricing tables, important rows/columns in tables, etc. 

9. User Experience
  a) What is User Experience (UX)
    --> "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works" - Steave Jobs
    --> User Interface (UI) is the visual presentation of a product. It's how the graphical interface looks and feels like
      --> Layout
      --> "Personality"
      --> Typography, colors, icons, etc. 
    --> User Experience (UX) is the overall experience the user has while interacting with the product
      --> Does the app feel logical and well thought out?
      --> Does the navigation work intuitively?
      --> Are users reaching their goals?

  b) UI and UX Design
    --> UI is the graphical interface: UI Design is what makes an interface beautiful
    --> UX is experience with interface: UX Design is what makes an interface useful and functional
    --> UX Design can not exist without UI Design

  c) UX Design Guiding Principle: Goals
    --> A website application exists for a reason: a user has a goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it
      --> Good UX design aligns the user's goals with the business' goals

  d) UX Rules for Usability
    1. Don't design complicated layouts. Don't reivent the weel. Use patters tha users know.
    2. Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make the text descriptive
    3. Use blue text and underlined text only for links!
    4. Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 ms
    5. In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
    6. Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, form success, etc. [web apps]
    7. Place action button where they will create an effect (law of locality) [web apps]
    
  e) UX Rules for Website Content
    8. Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page. Don't be vague or fancy!
    9. Only include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff and make the content 100% clear
    10. Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and "smart-sounding" words
    11. Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block quotes, bullet points, etc.

THE MISSING PIECE
--> Design ingredients
--> Web personalities
--> Design guidelines & rules
--> Gettign inspired and stealing like an artist: not completely copying a design! Instead, it's about taking good parts and adaptiong them to our needs
